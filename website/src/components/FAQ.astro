  {
    question: "How does Mingle verify I'm at a venue?",
    answer: "We use a combination of location services and QR code scanning at participating venues. You'll need to be physically present to check in and see other users."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do matches expire after 24 hours?",
    answer: "We believe great connections happen in the moment. The expiry encourages you to actually meet and chat while you're both at the venue, rather than letting conversations go stale."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when I run out of messages?",
    answer: "After 10 messages each, the conversation pauses. You can request a reconnect when you're both at the same venue again, which gives you a fresh set of messages."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Mingle free?",
    answer: "Yes! Mingle is completely free to use. We believe everyone should have access to meaningful connections without paywalls."
  },
  {
    question: "What venues work with Mingle?",
    answer: "We're partnering with bars, cafes, clubs, and event spaces in major cities. During our beta, we're focused on Sydney, Australia with plans to expand."
  },
  {
    question: "How is my data protected?",
    answer: "We only collect what's necessary and never sell your data. Your exact location is never shared - only your presence at a venue is visible to other users."
  }
