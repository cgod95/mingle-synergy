   - Venue list load: Target < 2 seconds | **Actual: 1.7 seconds** ✅
   - User profiles load: Target < 1.5 seconds | **Actual: 1.3 seconds** ✅

2. **Responsiveness**
   - Time to interactive: Target < 3.5 seconds | **Actual: 3.2 seconds** ✅
   - Input latency: Target < 100ms | **Actual: 85ms** ✅
   - Scroll performance: Target 60fps | **Actual: 58fps average** ⚠️

3. **Network Efficiency**
   - Initial payload size: Target < 1MB | **Actual: 1.2MB** ⚠️
   - Image optimization: Target < 200KB per image | **Actual: 175KB average** ✅
   - API response times: Target < 500ms | **Actual: 420ms average** ✅

4. **Resource Usage**
   - Memory usage: Monitor for leaks | **Finding: No significant leaks detected** ✅
   - CPU usage: Target < 30% during normal operation | **Actual: 25% average** ✅
   - Battery impact: Target < 5% per hour of active use | **Actual: 4.2% per hour** ✅

## Testing Procedures

### Load Testing
- Simulated 100 concurrent users accessing venues
- API response times remained stable up to 75 users
- Performance degradation observed at 85+ concurrent users
- Backend scaled appropriately with increased load

### Stress Testing
- **Finding:** App maintains stability during peak usage scenarios
- Memory usage peaked at 180MB during high-intensity operations
- App recovered gracefully from network interruptions
- Minor UI lag observed when loading 50+ user profiles simultaneously

### Endurance Testing
- App ran for 6 hours continuously without crashing
- Memory usage increased by 15% over time but stabilized
- Battery consumption remained consistent throughout test
- No performance degradation observed over extended use

## Performance Testing Tools
- Lighthouse scores: Performance 88, Accessibility 95, Best Practices 92
- Chrome DevTools Timeline showed some render blocking resources
- Firebase Performance Monitoring set up and collecting metrics
- React Profiler identified optimization opportunities in venue list rendering

## Performance Benchmarks
| Feature | Benchmark | Current | Target |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| App startup time | Time to interactive | 3.2s | < 3.5s ✅ |
| Venue list rendering | Time to render | 1.7s | < 2s ✅ |
| Match creation | Processing time | 0.8s | < 1s ✅ |
| Profile image loading | Loading time | 450ms | < 500ms ✅ |
| Location services | Response time | 1.2s | < 1s ⚠️ |
