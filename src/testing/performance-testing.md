# Performance Testing Plan

## Key Performance Metrics

1. **Load Times**
   - App initial load: Target < 3 seconds
   - Screen transitions: Target < 300ms
   - Venue list load: Target < 2 seconds
   - User profiles load: Target < 1.5 seconds

2. **Responsiveness**
   - Time to interactive: Target < 3.5 seconds
   - Input latency: Target < 100ms
   - Scroll performance: Target 60fps

3. **Network Efficiency**
   - Initial payload size: Target < 1MB
   - Image optimization: Target < 200KB per image
   - API response times: Target < 500ms

4. **Resource Usage**
   - Memory usage: Monitor for leaks
   - CPU usage: Target < 30% during normal operation
   - Battery impact: Target < 5% per hour of active use

## Testing Procedures

### Load Testing
- Simulate 100 concurrent users accessing venues
- Measure response times for key API endpoints
- Identify performance bottlenecks

### Stress Testing
- Simulate peak usage scenarios (e.g., popular venue with many users)
- Test with limited device resources (memory constraints)
- Test network throttling and poor connectivity scenarios

### Endurance Testing
- Run app for extended periods (4+ hours)
- Monitor for memory leaks
- Check battery consumption over time

## Performance Testing Tools
- Lighthouse (Web performance)
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Firebase Performance Monitoring
- React Profiler
- WebPageTest for initial load metrics

## Performance Benchmarks
| Feature | Benchmark | Current | Target |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| App startup time | Time to interactive | | < 3.5s |
| Venue list rendering | Time to render | | < 2s |
| Match creation | Processing time | | < 1s |
| Profile image loading | Loading time | | < 500ms |
| Location services | Response time | | < 1s |

## Optimization Focus Areas
- Image loading and optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Caching strategies
- Reducing render blocking resources
- Optimizing Firebase queries
