## 📱 Message Template

```
Hey [Name]! 👋

I've been working on something cool and I'd love your help testing it!

🎯 What is it?
Mingle - an app for meeting people at the same venue, at the same time. No swiping, no endless chatting. Just real connections in real places.

🧪 What I need:
I'm doing a beta test with friends and would love you to join! It's super quick - just come to [Venue Name] on [Date] at [Time], scan a QR code, and test it out.

⏱️ Time commitment:
About 30 minutes - check in, browse people, maybe match with someone, send a few messages.

🎁 What's in it for you:
- First to try something new
- Help shape the product
- Free drinks? (maybe 😉)
- Your feedback is super valuable!

📱 How to join:
1. Click this link: [Staging URL]
2. Click "Try Demo Mode" (no signup needed for testing)
3. Come to [Venue Name] on [Date]
4. Scan the QR code when you arrive
5. Have fun and give me feedback!

Let me know if you're in! 🚀

[Your Name]
```

1. **Personalize:** Use their name, mention why you thought of them
2. **Keep it casual:** Friends respond better to casual invites
3. **Be clear:** Set expectations (time, location, what to do)
4. **Make it easy:** Provide direct link, clear instructions
5. **Add value:** Mention what's in it for them
6. **Follow up:** Send reminder 1-2 days before event
