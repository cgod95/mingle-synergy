## 💡 How Mingle Works

### The Flow:
1. **Check In** → Select your current venue (must be within 500m)
2. **See People** → View others checked in at the same venue
3. **Like** → Show interest in someone
4. **Match** → If they like you back, you match!
5. **Chat** → Send 10 messages to make plans
6. **Meet** → Connect in person!

### Key Features:
